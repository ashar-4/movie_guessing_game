# movie_guessing_game
This program displays an incomplete string, which is basically the name of a movie (Bollywood or Hollywood). The user has to enter (guess) the character that he/she feels will fit in the string correctly. The user can also try and enter the characters already shown in the display initially, in order to check their presence elsewhere. The user can make a maximum of 5 wrong entries(guesses) after which the game ends and the correct answer is displayed.
